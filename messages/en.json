We share faith, values, and the desire to build a strong family.\n\nI’m a Protestant Christian and strive to live a life aligned with biblical principles. I identify with the Baptist doctrine, as I believe it to be a faithful interpretation of the Scriptures. My faith guides my decisions and serves as the foundation upon which I build my life.\n\nI’m passionate about cars and have always been fascinated by the automotive world. I appreciate the design, engineering, and history behind each vehicle. While I don’t have deep technical knowledge, I truly admire the innovation and evolution within the industry.\n\nRAP music has a strong influence on me, especially for its raw, honest, and socially conscious messages. I closely follow freestyle battles, particularly in the Brazilian scene. I value the creativity, technique, and powerful expression that this art form demands."
